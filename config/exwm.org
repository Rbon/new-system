Make sure that =<menu>= is captured and not sent to exwm windows. It took me a long time to figure out the syntax for this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq exwm-input-prefix-keys '(menu))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq exwm-input-simulation-keys
        '(([?\s-c] . [C-c])
          ([?\s-v] . [C-v])
          ([?\s-x] . [C-x])
          ([?\s-z] . [C-z])
        ))

Right now, this is basically taken verbatim from [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/blob/master/show-notes/Emacs-Desktop-01.org#setting-up-exwm][the "emacs from scratch" dotfiles]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq exwm-input-global-keys
        `(
          ;; Reset to line-mode (C-c C-k switches to char-mode via exwm-input-release-keyboard)
          ([?\s-r] . exwm-reset)

          ;; Move between windows
          ([s-left] . windmove-left)
          ([s-right] . windmove-right)
          ([s-up] . windmove-up)
          ([s-down] . windmove-down)

          ;; Launch applications via shell command
          ([?\s-&] . (lambda (command)
                       (interactive (list (read-shell-command "$ ")))
                       (start-process-shell-command command nil command)))))
#+end_src

This needs to be called /after/ all the configuration.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (exwm-enable)
#+end_src
